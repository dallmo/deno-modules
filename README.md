# this repo is obsoleted. 

and migrated to https://deno.land/x/dallmo_util_yaml

---

## background info

this module was publised initially via the repo :
https://github.com/dallmo/deno-modules

then tried switching to another repo for naming consistency ( and avoid a monorepo ) :
https://github.com/dallmo/deno-dallmo-yaml

but even emailed to modules@deno.com for the request, there is no response / reply for more than a few days.
related stakeoverflow thread here

so instead of keeping waiting with no concrete schedule, both of the above repos will be obsoleted, and finally it would now be grouped under dallmo_util, or can be accessed directly as dallmo_util_yaml.
